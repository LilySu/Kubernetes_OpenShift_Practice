Kubernetes
1. Standard Package Format - Package in containers
2. Manifest - Describe what it is

Orchestration - getting multiple components to work seamlessly together

What's in the yaml file:
- what container to use
- ports, networks, replicas

Master / Control Plane
- the brain of K8s
The master makes a copy of the yaml file and uses the yaml file as instructions

It's best to have multiple masters / multi-master control plane 3 or 5 is ideal
- odd so that 1 master can be easily elected as the leader

    - if the network goes down between 2 and 2 nodes, no one node is sure that
    they can communicate with the majority called split brain.

Followers proxy connections across to the leader.
If leader goes down, followers elect a new leader.

1 or more linux machines ie bare metal or on cloud are needed to run masters.
Every master runs a master component
Every master runs a control plane service

In a hosted Kubernetes platform, masters are hidden from you
- when your cloud provider runs Kubernetes for you as a service
- you are given an api endpoint
- you outsource the kubernetes control plane to your cloud provider
    - in return you get a production rate cluster with close to zero effort

It's a good practice not to run user or business applications on masters
