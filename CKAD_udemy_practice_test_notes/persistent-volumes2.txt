kubectl delete pvc claim-log-1

when we delete the pvc, it is stuck in a terminating state because it is 
used as a reference for the pod. Only when the pod is deleted 
referencing the pv, does the pvc get deleted with it. The state of teh 
pv would be in state Released, as it is freed up to be used again.
