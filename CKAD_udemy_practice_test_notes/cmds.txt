In Docker:
Entrypoint defines the first program that will be run within the 
container. It is meant to be a first command. The user may enter a 
parameter such as number of seconds in the command line. 
CMD is meant to go after entrypoint to define a default value if a 
parameter is not stated in the command line. CMD values will append 
Entrypoint.
